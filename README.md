Sorry but the readme isn't ready yet! It'll give more details on how the generator works as well as how to use it effectively.

Important Note:
You'll need to set up your own assets.json and assets folder for your race to have proper sprites.
If you want to add custom portraits and images to your race/mod you'll need to make some additional changes. You can find out more in the official guide which can be found in your game folder at 'Soulsash 2/data/docs/index.html'.
